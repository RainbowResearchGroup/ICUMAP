# ICUMAP
Overview and detail for thousands of multivariate clinical time-series.

ICUMAP is compromised of three modules: MetaVision, Layout, and Visualisation. 
A very brief overview of each is given here. For more details and installation instructions, refer to 
the README files in each of those three sub-directories.

#### MetaVision
Use this to extract data from a MetaVision 5 database in the format required by the other two modules.

#### Layout
Use this to generate a dimension-reduced layout of patient time-series.

#### Visualisation
Use this to display the dimension-reduced layout produced by the Layout module as an interactive HTML visualisation.
